                            <p> 
Mission of Police Force Engagement is to Maintain order, prevent and detect crime by enforcing law firmly and impartially, without fear or favor, prejudice or vindictiveness. Earlier,the police station employed manual procedures to keep track of all the police officers' data and to input records. This produced chaos since it's difficult for people to manage a large volume of data, which leads to data manipulation. 
<br>
Police Force engagement web application has the capability to control crimes as it can provide the availability of police at any time and place. 

<br>
This also has the ability to check the availability of all posted officers in police stations and the status of work assigned to them. This is achievable because the police authority can quickly determine the absence of police officers from the police station. This will also enable the authorities to determine the efficacy and efficiency of the police employees in handling a certain case.
